# Fishery_Explorer
A web application for fishermen where they can come and update their fishing pattern. This will prevent the by-catch which is one of the major problems. As per researchers, only 2 out of 3 fishes are eatable.

There are two features that we couldn't implement due to shortage of time and unfavourable circumstances due to COVID-19.
The first one is the bycatch dashboard for premium customers.
And the second is tracking the fishermen with the help of Geo loaction.
